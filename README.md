#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To understand what users need, I listen carefully to their problems and what they are trying to accomplish. Instead of jumping to solutions right away, I try to see things from their point of view. Creating user stories helps because it breaks down what users want into small, clear goals written in everyday language. A good user story usually follows the format: "As a [user], I want [something] so that [benefit]." This makes it easier for me to build features that actually solve their problems and make their experience better.
# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I start developing programs, I like to plan a little, but then jump into building small parts and testing them early. I don’t want to wait until the very end to find out if something doesn’t work. I hope to use Agile processes like Sprint Planning (choosing small tasks to work on first), Daily Stand-ups (quick team check-ins), and Retrospectives (talking about what went well and what didn’t after each project cycle). Agile helps keep the work flexible, organized, and focused on making improvements step-by-step.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means more than just writing good code. It’s about communicating well, being dependable, and respecting everyone's ideas. If someone needs help, you offer it. If something is wrong, you speak up early instead of staying quiet. It’s important to share your progress, listen to feedback, and work together to solve problems. A good team member puts the success of the whole project above just their own work.
